# Architecture

The project uses a base context for storage but setup using hooks for dealing with business logic.  Normally I would opts for React Query as this provides much better options like cache control etc, so the hooks mimic off this slightly.

Both light and dark themes are support with a useTheme hook and the help of a helper function makeStyles allows updating styles locally in the component with the theme dynamically.

Finally I created a useStoreState hook which offers simular functionality to useState but works with MMKV for sync storage.
